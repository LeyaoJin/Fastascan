Sorry, I just found out that the AI version does not count the total number of unique ids and total files processed. I thought that the AI version was just an improved version including things we have not seen in class. Anyway, I'm still trying to see how can I debug it, because I don't know why it does not work and chatgpt neither, it may due to the while loop? But chatgpt keeps telling me that the while loop is better than the for loop i did for my script, so I don't know. I did the script before 3rd december but didn't know I had to upload it in Github little by little, so the uploads are more focused on the robustness. Next time I will read the whole text before starting the assignment, sorry :(.
